We had the MeteorHacks Show 2 on the 16th, and it was a very successful event with more than 200 attendees. We had Meteor developers from around the world, and the chat on the crowdcast was super busy.

(There was an issue with the audio in some parts; we’ll improve that next time.)

Our main topic was server-side rendering, and I did a follow-up blog post based on the talk I did. You can read it here:
