Let's imagine you've a blog powered by Meteor. It's URL format looks like `/post/:_id`. Here's an actual URL for one of your blog post: <http://myblog.com/post/meteor-rocks>. 

Let's install FastRender

> Since, still we've not released yet, you need to install FastRender from git. Add following to your [`smart.json`](https://github.com/arunoda/fast-render-telescope/blob/master/smart.json#L12-L14) or clone the project into the packages directory.

    "fast-render": {
      "git": "git://github.com/arunoda/meteor-fast-render.git"
    }

Add following code to your app

    if(Meteor.isServer) {
      FastRender.route('/blog/:_id', function(params) {
        //assumes 'blogPost' is the publication which sends
        //the given blog post
        this.subscribe('blogPost', params._id);
      })
    }

Now your blog is powered by FastRender. It will load very fast.

__*Fast Render*__ works with any Meteor app. Just add it and create some routes; it just works.

> FastRender works really well with IronRouter. You don't even need to declare any special routes. [Click here](/fast-render/iron-router-support/) for more information.
